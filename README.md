# Hierarch

Build pages, quick and easy.

![Basic Use Case](./recordings/basic_use_case.gif)

Build pages using common and easy in-place changes,  
producing clean code you can use in any place you like.

Hierarch records changes in your source code as you make upgrades.

## Run on a local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/assembleapp/hierarch.git
cd hierarch
yarn

# Run in parallel:
node hierarch.js &
yarn start
```

## Program

Hierarch is designed to help people build online programs as solid and reliable as can be;  
while avoiding the steep learning curves that plague the discipline of machine coding.

The three cylinders of the Hierarch programming engine are:

* Disk (basic launch planned January 2021)
* Grid
* Pose

These three cylinders replace the common programming paradigms of  
object storage, relational databases, and web markup; in order.

Hierarch's underlying cylinders are designed to signal each other seamlessly as a program runs,  
purring along and cheerily running your program on users' machines across our globe.

## License

While under development, Assemble LLC's Hierarch engine code is open-source but unlicensed.
Use of this unlicensed code is dangerous for people hoping to build secure web applications,
so we cannot recommend - or even express our legal permission for - its use,
until secure policies and boundaries are made and programmed in.

If you would like to use this engine to build a program,  
please leave a remark in the [discussions] describing your build goals.
