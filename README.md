# Hierarch

Make pages, quick and easy.

Build pages using common and easy in-place changes,  
producing clean code you can use in any place you like.

Hierarch records changes in your source code as you make upgrades.

![Basic Use Case](./recordings/basic_use_case.gif)

Machine coding is a hard discipline;  
Hierarch cleans up some rough edges.

Imagine guard rails around your design-and-build process.  
Our program helps people build pages online,  
as solid and reliable as can be.

## An Engine in an Early Phase

As Hierarch grows and changes,  
you'll be able to do more with less.  
Keep your eye on our [discussions].

## Run on a local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/assembleapp/hierarch
cd hierarch
yarn

# Run in parallel:
node hierarch &
yarn go
```

In your browser, see <http://0.0.0.0:3000>.  
Click the cube, then press spacebar and secondary-click your mouse.  
Click around your page and make changes,  
keeping an eye on your code in `src/App.js`.
